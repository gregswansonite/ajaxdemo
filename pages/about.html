			AJAX Demo was built using jQuery, PHP and JSON. The layout and styling uses Bootstrap. All of the data is stored on a MySQL database. All of the code for this project is available on GitHub.

			This app allows a user to add contacts and then submit orders. Users are not allowed to enter an order unless there is an existing contact saved. Contacts and orders can be removed using the red buttons on each record.
		</p>	
		<p>
			All of the data entries and deletions are done using jQuery AJAX requests. All of the button and tab page loading functionality is also handled by jQuery. The back-end API consists of a few PHP files that take insertion, deletion and display requests. The API display request returns all of the records in each requested table, in JSON format.
